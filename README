Vim configuration files (needs 7.3+, +python, +ruby)

Installation
============

The configurations use vundle and pathogen(for testing bundles, or managing
scripts which can or should not be managed by vundle).  The installation files
for vundle bundles is '~/.vim/vundle' and the pathogen based bundles are stored
in '~/.vim/bundle'. pathogen is itself managed by 'vundle'.

1. create dynamic links if necessary

    $ ln -s <repo dir>/vim ~/.vim
    $ ln -s <repo dir>/vimrc ~/.vimrc

2. download vundle package

    $ mkdir ~/.vim/vundle
    $ git clone http://github.com/gmarik/vundle.git ~/.vim/vundle/vundle

3. install vundle based packages

    $ vim -u ~/.vim/vundles.vim +BundleInstall +q

4. build command-t helper executables:

    $ cd ~/.vim/vundle/command-t/ruby/command-t
    $ ruby extconf.rb
    $ make

Usage:
======

- Additional local or platform specific options can be configured in
  ~/.vimrc.local, which will be automatically loaded by vim.

- list of installed vundles and vundle configurations are to be found
  in ~/.vim/vundles.vim
